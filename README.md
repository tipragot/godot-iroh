## Usage

This plugin allows you to establish peer-to-peer multiplayer connections in Godot without relying on a centralized server. It uses a host to initialize the connection, leveraging the power of [Iroh](https://www.iroh.computer/).

### Starting a Host (Server)

To start a server and set it as the multiplayer peer:

```gdscript
var server := IrohServer.start()
multiplayer.multiplayer_peer = server
```

You can retrieve the connection string (to share with clients) using:

```gdscript
server.connection_string()
```

### Connecting as a Client

To connect to an existing host using the connection string:

```gdscript
var client = IrohClient.connect("CONNECTION_STRING")
multiplayer.multiplayer_peer = client
```

Replace `"CONNECTION_STRING"` with the string provided by the host server.

After initializing the peer, all other methods are the same as in the [godot documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/networking/high_level_multiplayer.html) (without the [Initializing the network](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/networking/high_level_multiplayer.html#initializing-the-network) part).

### Handle Client Errors

To handle connection failures on the client side, you can connect to the connection_failed signal:

```gdscript
multiplayer.connection_failed.connect(func():
    print("Connection error: ", client.connection_error()))
```
This allows you to gracefully handle cases where the client cannot connect to the host.
